    <h2>Async and Await</h2>
    <p><strong>Async</strong> and <strong>Await</strong> are keywords introduced in JavaScript ES2017 (ES8) that make working with asynchronous code easier and more readable. These keywords are used to work with <code>Promises</code> and simplify the process of writing asynchronous code by avoiding callback hell or chaining promises.</p>
    
    <h3>Async Function</h3>
    <p>An <code>async</code> function is a function that always returns a promise. Other values are automatically wrapped in a resolved promise. When using <code>async</code> functions, you can write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style, which makes it easier to understand and maintain.</p>

    <h3>Await Expression</h3>
    <p>The <code>await</code> keyword can only be used inside an <code>async</code> function. It makes the function wait for the promise to resolve or reject before moving on to the next line of code. The code following <code>await</code> is paused until the promise is resolved, and then it continues execution.</p>

    <p>In simple terms:
    <ul>
        <li><code>async</code> makes a function return a promise.</li>
        <li><code>await</code> makes JavaScript wait until the promise is resolved or rejected before continuing.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How Async and Await Work?</h2>
    <p>Before <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, asynchronous code was usually handled with callbacks or promises. However, these methods could lead to complex, nested code that was difficult to read and maintain, especially when performing multiple asynchronous operations sequentially.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of <code>async/await</code>, the code looks cleaner, and it allows us to write asynchronous code that appears synchronous.</p>

    <h3>Basic Syntax of Async/Await</h3>
    <pre><code>async function exampleFunction() {
    let result = await someAsyncFunction();
    console.log(result);
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Example of Async/Await</h3>
    <p>Let’s look at an example where we use <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to fetch data from an API:</p>
    <pre><code>
async function fetchData() {
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the <code>fetchData()</code> function is declared with the <code>async</code> keyword. Inside the function, we use <code>await</code> to pause the execution until the <code>fetch()</code> promise is resolved. Once the promise is resolved, the data is logged to the console.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Handling Errors with Async/Await</h2>
    <p>Just like with promises, <code>async/await</code> allows you to handle errors. You can use the <code>try...catch</code> statement to handle errors in an <code>async</code> function. This is very useful when you want to deal with errors in a more readable and straightforward manner.</p>

    <h3>Syntax for Error Handling</h3>
    <pre><code>async function example() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Error:', error);
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Example of Error Handling</h3>
    <pre><code>
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
    }
}

fetchData();
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the <code>try...catch</code> block is used to handle any errors that might occur during the asynchronous operation. If the <code>fetch()</code> request fails or if any error occurs during the execution, it will be caught by the <code>catch</code> block, and an error message will be logged to the console.</p>

    <h2>Async/Await with Multiple Promises</h2>
    <p>In some cases, you may want to perform multiple asynchronous operations, and you may need to wait for all of them to complete before continuing with the execution. With <code>async/await</code>, this can be achieved by combining multiple promises.</p>

    <h3>Example of Multiple Promises</h3>
    <pre><code>
async function fetchMultipleData() {
    let response1 = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    let response2 = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
    
    let data1 = await response1.json();
    let data2 = await response2.json();
    
    console.log('Posts:', data1);
    console.log('Users:', data2);
}

fetchMultipleData();
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we fetch data from two different URLs sequentially using <code>await</code>. The function pauses until the first fetch request is complete, then it moves on to the second fetch request, and so on. Both sets of data are logged once they are both resolved.</p>

    <h3>Parallel Requests</h3>
    <p>If you want to run multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously (in parallel), you can use <code>Promise.all()</code> together with <code>async/await</code>.</p>

    <h3>Example of Parallel Promises</h3>
    <pre><code>
async function fetchParallelData() {
    let [response1, response2] = await Promise.all([
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'),
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
    ]);

    let data1 = await response1.json();
    let data2 = await response2.json();

    console.log('Posts:', data1);
    console.log('Users:', data2);
}

fetchParallelData();
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, both <code>fetch()</code> calls are executed in parallel using <code>Promise.all()</code>. The function waits for both promises to resolve before continuing, improving performance when you need to run multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Async and Await</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cleaner Code:</strong> Async and await provide a more readable and synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code, which reduces the complexity and makes the code easier to maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Error handling is more straightforward with <code>try...catch</code> blocks, which are easier to use than handling errors with promise chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Debugging:</strong> Debugging asynchronous code is easier since you don’t have to deal with multiple levels of callbacks or promise chains.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
            It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and was released in 1995.
            Java is widely used for developing robust, secure, and scalable applications across various domains.

        <h3>History of Java</h3>
        <p>
            Java was initiated by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1991. Originally called Oak, the language was later renamed Java, inspired by the coffee that was consumed in large amounts by its creators.
            The main goal was to create a platform-independent language for embedded devices.

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Java syntax is straightforward and easy to learn, particularly for programmers familiar with C++.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java is fully object-oriented, focusing on objects to represent data and methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capability enables Java programs to run on any platform with JVM support.</li>
            <li><strong>Secured:</strong> Java offers robust security features, such as classloaders, bytecode verifiers, and the Security Manager.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Java ensures strong memory management, garbage collection, and exception handling, making it a reliable choice for developers.</li>
            <li><strong>Architecture-Neutral:</strong> Java provides a consistent memory model across all architectures.</li>
            <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Java bytecode can be carried to and executed on any platform.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Performance:</strong> While interpreted, Java bytecode is close to native machine code for efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Java simplifies the development of distributed applications using technologies like RMI and EJB.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-threaded:</strong> Java supports concurrent execution of multiple threads, crucial for modern applications.</li>

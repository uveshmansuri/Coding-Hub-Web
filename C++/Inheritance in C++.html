        <h2>What is Inheritance?</h2>
        <p>Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It allows a class (known as the derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) of another class (known as the base class). This promotes code reusability, extensibility, and modularity in programs.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Inheritance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> The derived class can reuse the methods and properties of the base class.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> New functionalities can be added to derived classes without modifying the base class.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Structure:</strong> Enables the creation of class hierarchies, which represent real-world relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Inheritance supports runtime polymorphism, allowing derived classes to override base class methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Inheritance in C++</h2>
        <p>C++ supports the following types of inheritance:</p>

        <h3>1. Single Inheritance</h3>
        <p>In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from only one base class.</p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../single_inherit.png">
        </div>

        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void displayBase() {
        cout << "This is the Base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void displayDerived() {
        cout << "This is the Derived class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.displayBase();    // Accessing base class method
    obj.displayDerived(); // Accessing derived class method
    return 0;
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
This is the Base class.
This is the Derived class.
        </pre>

        <h3>2. Multiple Inheritance</h3>
        <p>In multiple inheritance, a derived class inherits from more than one base class.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../multipleinh_img.png">
        </div>
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Base1 {
public:
    void displayBase1() {
        cout << "This is Base1 class." << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void displayBase2() {
        cout << "This is Base2 class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void displayDerived() {
        cout << "This is the Derived class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.displayBase1();    // Accessing Base1 class method
    obj.displayBase2();    // Accessing Base2 class method
    obj.displayDerived();  // Accessing Derived class method
    return 0;
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
This is Base1 class.
This is Base2 class.
This is the Derived class.
        </pre>

        <h3>3. Hierarchical Inheritance</h3>
        <p>In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../hirearchical_img.png">
        </div>
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void displayBase() {
        cout << "This is the Base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived1 : public Base {
public:
    void displayDerived1() {
        cout << "This is the Derived1 class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived2 : public Base {
public:
    void displayDerived2() {
        cout << "This is the Derived2 class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived1 obj1;
    Derived2 obj2;

    obj1.displayBase();
    obj1.displayDerived1();

    obj2.displayBase();
    obj2.displayDerived2();

    return 0;
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
This is the Base class.
This is the Derived1 class.
This is the Base class.
This is the Derived2 class.
        </pre>

        <h3>4. Multilevel Inheritance</h3>
        <p>In multilevel inheritance, a derived class acts as a base class for another class.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../multi_inherit.jpg">
        </div>
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void displayBase() {
        cout << "This is the Base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Intermediate : public Base {
public:
    void displayIntermediate() {
        cout << "This is the Intermediate class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Intermediate {
public:
    void displayDerived() {
        cout << "This is the Derived class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.displayBase();
    obj.displayIntermediate();
    obj.displayDerived();

    return 0;
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
This is the Base class.
This is the Intermediate class.
This is the Derived class.
        </pre>

        <h3>5. Hybrid Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It usually involves the use of virtual base classes to avoid ambiguity caused by multiple inheritance.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../hybrid-inheritancepng.png">
        </div>
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void displayBase() {
        cout << "This is the Base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived1 : virtual public Base {};
class Derived2 : virtual public Base {};

class Derived3 : public Derived1, public Derived2 {
public:
    void displayDerived3() {
        cout << "This is the Derived3 class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived3 obj;
    obj.displayBase();  // Access Base class method
    obj.displayDerived3();
    return 0;
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <pre>
This is the Base class.
This is the Derived3 class.
        </pre>

        <h2>Access Control in Inheritance</h2>
        <p>The access specifiers (public, protected, private) play a vital role in inheritance. They control how the members of the base class are inherited by the derived class.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Inheritance:</strong> Public members of the base class remain public in the derived class, and protected members remain protected.</li>
            <li><strong>Protected Inheritance:</strong> Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Inheritance:</strong> Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Inheritance is a powerful concept in C++ that allows for the reusability of code, improved maintainability, and the implementation of OOP principles. Understanding its types and proper usage can lead to more efficient and flexible programming.</p>

    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>C Language</strong> is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed to write system software but is also used for application development. C is known for its efficiency and control over hardware.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>History of C Language</h2>
        <p>The C language has a rich history and a significant role in the evolution of programming:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1967:</strong> Martin Richards developed the BCPL language (Basic Combined Programming Language).</li>
            <li><strong>1970:</strong> Ken Thompson created the B language at Bell Labs.</li>
            <li><strong>1972:</strong> Dennis Ritchie developed the C programming language at Bell Labs to overcome the limitations of B language. C was used to rewrite the UNIX operating system.</li>
            <li><strong>1989:</strong> ANSI standardized C as ANSI C, followed by ISO standardization in 1990.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Key Milestone:</strong> C's success lies in its portability and efficiency, making it the backbone of many operating systems and compilers.

        <h2>Features of C Language</h2>
        <p>C offers several key features that make it a popular choice among developers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple and Efficient:</strong> Easy to learn and provides high-level control over system resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Code written in C can be compiled and run on different machines with minimal or no changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Rich Library:</strong> A wide range of built-in functions for various tasks like input/output, string handling, and mathematical operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured Language:</strong> Supports modular programming with functions, making it easy to debug and maintain code.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Level Access:</strong> Direct interaction with hardware using pointers, enabling efficient system-level programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Performance:</strong> Compiles directly into machine code, ensuring high-speed execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> New functions can be added to enhance the language’s functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Program</h2>
        <p>Below is a simple program in C to print "Hello, World!":</p>
        <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Applications of C Language</h2>
        <p>C language is versatile and used in various domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Unix, Linux, and Windows kernel development.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Microcontrollers and IoT devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Compilers:</strong> Many modern programming language compilers are written in C.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Low-level libraries and engines use C for performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Systems:</strong> Popular databases like MySQL are developed in C.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The C programming language is foundational in computer science. Its efficiency, flexibility, and influence on subsequent languages like C++, Java, and Python make it a vital language to learn.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Input and output devices are essential parts of any computer system, allowing for communication between the user and the computer. Input devices enable users to send data or commands to the computer, while output devices display or produce the results from the computer's processing. Both types of devices are integral to a computer's operation, providing the interface for interaction and feedback.</p>

        <h2>Input Devices</h2>
        <p>Input devices allow users to provide data or commands to a computer system. These devices convert physical actions into signals that the computer can interpret. Some of the most common input devices include:</p>
        
        <h3>Common Input Devices</h3>

            <div>
                <h3>Keyboard</h3>
                <p>The keyboard is one of the most commonly used input devices. It allows users to input text, numbers, and special characters into the computer. The keys are mapped to corresponding ASCII values, and when a key is pressed, it sends a signal to the CPU to process the action. Keyboards are available in different layouts, such as QWERTY, and may include additional keys for special functions.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Mouse</h3>
                <p>The mouse is another popular input device that enables users to interact with the graphical interface of the computer. By moving the mouse on a flat surface, users control the movement of the cursor on the screen. Mice often come with additional buttons for right-click, left-click, and scrolling. Modern mice may also include a touchpad or optical sensors for more precise control.</p>

                <h3>Scanner</h3>
                <p>A scanner is used to convert physical documents, photos, and other items into digital form. There are different types of scanners, such as flatbed scanners and handheld scanners. Scanners use optical sensors to capture an image and convert it into a digital file that can be saved, edited, or processed by the computer.</p>
            </div>
            <br>            
            <div>
                <h3>Microphone</h3>
                <p>Microphones are used to capture sound and convert it into digital signals. This input device is commonly used for voice recognition, audio recording, and video conferencing. Microphones work by converting sound vibrations into electrical signals, which are then digitized by the computer.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Specialized Input Devices</h3>
        <p>In addition to basic input devices, there are also specialized input devices used for specific tasks:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Touchpad:</strong> A flat, touch-sensitive surface that allows users to interact with the computer by swiping or tapping.</li>
            <li><strong>Joystick:</strong> A device used primarily for gaming or simulation, allowing for movement control in games or software.</li>
            <li><strong>Webcam:</strong> A small camera that captures video and images, commonly used for video calls, live streaming, or security monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Output Devices</h2>
        <p>Output devices display or produce the results of the computer's processing. These devices convert data from the computer into a form that humans can understand, whether through visual, auditory, or tactile feedback. Below are some of the most common output devices:</p>

        <h3>Common Output Devices</h3>
        <div class="comparison">
            <div>
                <h3>Monitor</h3>
                <p>The monitor is the primary output device for displaying visual information. It is a screen that shows the graphical user interface (GUI), text, images, and videos. Modern monitors use LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology, offering high resolutions and vibrant colors. Monitors are available in various sizes and shapes, including flat-screen and curved models.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Printer</h3>
                <p>Printers are output devices that convert digital documents or images into physical copies. There are several types of printers, including inkjet, laser, and dot matrix printers. Inkjet printers spray liquid ink onto paper to create images and text, while laser printers use toner and heat to fuse the image onto paper.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="comparison">
            <div>
                <h3>Speakers</h3>
                <p>Speakers are output devices that produce sound. They convert digital audio signals into audible sound, enabling the user to hear music, notifications, and other audio content. Speakers can be external or built into the computer system, and their quality depends on the hardware and audio settings.</p>
            </div>

        <h3>Specialized Output Devices</h3>
        <p>Some output devices are designed for specific purposes beyond visual or auditory feedback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3D Printer:</strong> A printer that creates three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer. This is often used in prototyping and manufacturing.</li>
            <li><strong>Haptic Feedback Devices:</strong> These devices provide tactile feedback, such as vibrations or forces, allowing users to "feel" virtual objects in simulation environments or gaming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interaction Between Input and Output Devices</h2>
        <p>Input and output devices work together to allow the user to interact with the computer. For example, when a user types on a keyboard (input), the text appears on the monitor (output). Similarly, when the user clicks the mouse to select an item on the screen (input), the computer may provide feedback through the monitor or speakers (output). These interactions are essential for effective communication between the user and the computer, and they ensure that the computer responds to user input in a meaningful way.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Input and output devices are essential for any computer system. Input devices allow users to send data to the computer, while output devices display or produce the results of the computer’s processing. Both types of devices enable human-computer interaction, making it possible for users to work with and control computers efficiently. Understanding the various input and output devices and how they function helps us appreciate the versatility and capability of modern computing systems.</p>

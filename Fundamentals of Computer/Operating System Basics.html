        <h2>What is an Operating System (OS)?</h2>
        <p>An <strong>Operating System (OS)</strong> is system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and users. It provides a user interface and manages computer resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.</p>

        <h3>Key Functions of an Operating System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory for programs.</li>
            <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> Provides a structure for organizing, storing, and accessing data.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Manages hardware peripherals such as printers, scanners, and keyboards.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Provides a graphical or command-line interface for user interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
        <h3>1. Single-User, Single-Task OS</h3>
        <p>A system where one user can perform one task at a time. It is typically used in simple devices like old mobile phones or embedded systems.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)
        </div>

        <h3>2. Single-User, Multi-Tasking OS</h3>
        <p>This OS allows a single user to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as browsing the internet while editing a document.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Windows 10, macOS
        </div>

        <h3>3. Multi-User OS</h3>
        <p>Allows multiple users to access the system resources simultaneously. It is common in server environments.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> UNIX, Linux
        </div>

        <h3>4. Real-Time OS (RTOS)</h3>
        <p>Used in systems that require immediate response to external events. It is widely used in industrial and embedded systems.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> VxWorks, FreeRTOS
        </div>

        <h3>5. Distributed OS</h3>
        <p>A system where a group of computers work together to appear as a single system to the user. It is often used in cloud computing environments.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Apache Hadoop, Windows Server
        </div>

        <h3>6. Embedded OS</h3>
        <p>Designed for embedded systems that are built into devices to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Android for mobile phones, Embedded Linux
        </div>

        <h2>Operating System Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architecture of an OS defines how the different components interact. The two main architectures are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monolithic Kernel:</strong> All OS services run in a single layer. 
                <br>Example: Linux.
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="monolithic_os.jpeg" alt="Operating System Architecture">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Microkernel:</strong> 
                Only the essential services run in the kernel space, with other services in the user space.
                <br>Example: macOS, QNX.
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="microkernel_os.jpeg" alt="Operating System Architecture">
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>        
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Real-World Example: How OS Manages a Task</h2>
        <p>When you open a browser to visit a website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The OS allocates memory for the browser application.</li>
            <li>It schedules CPU time for the browser process.</li>
            <li>The file system retrieves the browser's program files.</li>
            <li>The network management system connects to the internet to load the website.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The operating system is the backbone of any computer system, managing hardware, software, and user interaction. Understanding its functions and types is crucial for utilizing technology effectively.</p>

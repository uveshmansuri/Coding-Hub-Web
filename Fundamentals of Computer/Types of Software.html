    <section>
        <p>Software is an integral part of any computer system. 
            It refers to a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers 
            and execute specific tasks. Broadly, software is classified into two main categories:
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>System Software</strong> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Application Software</strong>.<br> Each plays a vital role in ensuring the 
            smooth functioning of computing devices and providing utility to users.</p>

        <h2>1. System Software</h2>
        <p>System software is the backbone of any computing system. It provides a platform for running application software and manages hardware resources. System software acts as an intermediary between hardware and user-level software, ensuring smooth communication and operation.</p>

            <p><strong>System Software</strong> manages hardware resources and provides essential services for other software.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Examples of System Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems (OS):</strong> Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. These manage hardware resources and provide a user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Includes tools like disk cleanup utilities, antivirus programs, and file management systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Firmware:</strong> Embedded software that controls devices like routers, printers, and washing machines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Functions of System Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Management:</strong> Coordinates and manages the computer's hardware components like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform for Applications:</strong> Provides a base for running application software, ensuring they can access system resources efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Includes utilities that help optimize system performance, like defragmentation tools and system monitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Maintenance:</strong> Includes features like firewalls, antivirus programs, and backup tools to secure and maintain the system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages of System Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables interaction between hardware and software.</li>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Application Software</h2>
        <p>Application software is designed to help users perform specific tasks or activities. Unlike system software, it focuses on user-level operations and provides functionality that caters to end-user requirements. Application software runs on top of system software and cannot function without it.</p>

        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="app_soft.jpg" alt="Application Software Illustration">
            <p><strong>Application Software</strong> enables users to perform specific tasks like writing documents, browsing the web, or editing photos.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Examples of Application Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Productivity Software:</strong> Word processors (Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (Excel), and presentation tools (PowerPoint).</li>
            <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Software like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge for accessing the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimedia Software:</strong> Applications for editing photos, videos, or audio, such as Adobe Photoshop and VLC Media Player.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming Software:</strong> Games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and The Sims.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Software:</strong> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools like SAP and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software like Salesforce.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Functions of Application Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task-Specific:</strong> Designed to perform specific user tasks, such as creating documents, editing videos, or managing databases.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Provides an interface for users to interact with the software and complete their desired tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Many applications can be customized to fit the specific needs of the user or organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages of Application Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables users to perform a wide range of tasks.</li>
            <li>Provides user-friendly interfaces tailored to specific needs.</li>
            <li>Can be developed for various platforms, including desktops, mobile devices, and the web.</li>
